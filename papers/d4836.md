## Acknowledgements

Thanks to all those who have [submitted editorial
issues](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/wiki/How-to-submit-an-editorial-issue)
and to those who have provided pull requests with fixes.

## New papers

 * [N4835](http://wg21.link/n4835) is the current C++ working draft. It replaces [N4830](http://wg21.link/n4830).
 * N4836 is this Editors' Report.

## Motions incorporated into working draft

Fixed application of [P1643R1](http://wg21.link/p1643r1) (2019-07 LWG Motion 9):
two added paragraphs should have been labeled *Effects:* instead of *Expects:*.

Fixed application of [P1463R1](http://wg21.link/p1463r1) (2019-03 LWG Motion 10):
an added `!=` in [list.ops] has been replaced with the correct `==`.

## Notable editorial changes

### Improved indices

   * The index of library headers now shows the location of the header synopsis in boldface.
   * An index presenting all concept names (including exposition-only concepts) was added.
   * The main index and the index of library names now show subdivisions per letter.

### Changes to section labels

  * [source_location.syn] -> [source.location.syn]
  * [atomics.ref.operations] -> [atomics.ref.ops]

Several "Preamble" sections were added to avoid hanging paragraphs.
