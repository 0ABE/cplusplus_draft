## Notable changes to papers as moved

### LWG motion 11

#### LWG2534

The wording change applied here needed to be rebased onto the wording change
applied by LWG2328 as part of 2016-06 LWG Motion 1.

LWG2328 changes the rvalue ostream extractor to use perfect forwarding, changing from:

> ```
> template <class charT, class traits, class T>  
>   basic_istream<charT, traits>&  
>   operator>>(basic_istream<charT, traits>&& is, T& x);
> ```
>
> -1- *Effects:* `is >> x`

to:

> ```
> template <class charT, class traits, class T>  
>   basic_istream<charT, traits>&  
>   operator>>(basic_istream<charT, traits>&& is, T&& x);  
> ```
>
> -1- *Effects:* Equivalent to:
> ```
> is >> std::forward<T>(x);  
> return is;
> ```

LWG2534 adds a matching SFINAE condition, and proposes this wording based on
the standard prior to the application of LWG2328:

> -?- Remarks: This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless the expression `is >> x` is well-formed.

The two LWG issue resolutions have been editorially merged, resulting instead
in the addition of this SFINAE condition:

> -?- Remarks: This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless the expression `is >> std::forward<T>(x)` is well-formed.

#### LWG2543

The resolution of
[LWG issue 2543](http://wg21.link/lwg2543)
is made redundant and unnecessary by
LWG motion 27 in
[P0513R0](http://wg21.link/p0513r0),
which applies a more general fix to the same wording.
As a result, LWG2543's resolution has not been applied,
and instead LWG2543 should be marked as resolved by P0513R0.

#### LWG2753

The resolution of
[LWG issue 2753](http://wg21.link/lwg2753)
conflicts with the resolution of
[LWG issue 2756](http://wg21.link/lwg2756)
and has not been applied.
In particular,
LWG 2753 changes the draft to say that the
`optional(const optional<T>&)` constructor
should not participate in overload resolution
if `!is_copy_constructible_v<T>`, whereas
LWG 2756 changes the draft to say that the
constructor should be deleted in the same case.

### LWG motion 23

The wording of this paper intended to apply on top of the wording changes applied by 
[P0003](http://wg21.link/p0003r5) (applied by CWG motion 5 and LWG motion 20),
but was not updated to match the latest wording changes from P0003R5, and as a
result, many of its proposed changes are redundant with those applied by P0003R5. 
There is no conflict between the intent of the two papers, and both have
been applied.

## Disposition of editorial NB comments on C++ 2017 CD1

Listed below are draft disposition for all comments that were
filed as editorial in the ISO 14882 CD (2016) NB comments,
[p0488r0](http://wg21.link/p0488r0),
and the late editorial comments in [p0489r0](http://wg21.link/p0489r0).
Except where otherwise noted, these dispositions only represent the current
viewpoint of the Project Editor.

### ES Comments

ES 3: Accepted, fixed in f6482016.

 * Example is correct with or without proposed change.

### US Comments

US 4: No consensus for change.

 * While `_v` forms are generally preferred in library clauses, defining the core
language semantics in terms of a variable template seems to introduce undue
complexity.
 * CWG concurs with this direction.

US 9: Accepted, fixed in 97058f9c.

 * LWG concurs with this direction.

US 11: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 663f1324.

 * In the reference in paragraph 9, the `::value` was removed to match similar specifications.

US 12: Accepted, fixed in 0fdcc1ab.

US 13: Accepted with modifications, fixed by 79974877.

 * Specifying the value of `is_destructible_v<T>` within the specification for
`is_destructible` would be considerably less clear than specifying the value
of `is_destructible<T>::value`.

 * **Modified resolution:** Instead of proposed fix, change Condition for
`is_destructible` to:

> Condition: Either `T` is a reference type, or `T` is a complete object type
for which the expression `declval<U&>().~U()` is well-formed when treated
as an unevaluated operand (Clause [expr]), where `U` is
`remove_all_extents_t<T>`.

 * LWG concurs with this direction.

US 26: Accepted, fixed by 85aac089.

US 27: Accepted, fixed by fb925656.

US 38: Accepted, fixed by adb0da05.

 * LWG concurs with this direction.

US 39: Accepted, fixed by d47d5ca4.

 * LWG concurs with this direction. 

US 41: **LWG to handle issue**

 * LWG has deferred a decision on this to Kona.

US 42: **LWG to handle issue**

 * The suggested resolution contradicts [fs.op.status]/7, which indicates that
pathname resolution does always resolve a symlink. There is no other
specification of how pathname resolution behaves, so the proposed note would
not be justified by normative text.
 * LWG has deferred a decision on this to Kona.

 US 47: **LWG to handle issue**

 * LWG has deferred a decision on this to Kona.

US 50: **LWG to handle issue**

 * The proposed change seems valuable, but would be a normative change if the type
is an input iterator type for which `decay_t` would produce a different type.
The Project Editor would like LWG to consider whether that change is acceptable.
 * LWG has deferred a decision on this to Kona.

US 87: **SG1 to handle issue**

 * CWG considers the revised term to be less clear. A compromise term "block with
progress guarantee delegation" (removing the "forward" but retaining the
"guarantee") has been proposed.

US 88: Accepted, fixed in 554514cc.

US 89: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 7e920239, d580a0dd.

 * "+" in section heading replaced by "and"

US 90: Accepted, fixed in 131716c4.

US 91: Accepted, fixed in 0a344234.

 * LWG and SG1 concur with the direction of this issue.

US 96: Accepted, fixed in e6d9dfff.

US 97: Duplicate of US 4.

US 120: Accepted, fixed in a8f966f5.

 * LWG concurs with this direction.

US 133: Accepted, fixed in 71c347ed.

US 136: Accepted, fixed in 27b46764.

US 138: No consensus for change.

 * [func.requires] are requirements on the library, [requirements] are
requirements on the program. [func.requires] does not fit within
[requirements], nor within Clause 17 at all.
 * The call wrapper terms are not used outside the specified clause (except within
Annex D), so moving them to [definitions] does not seem useful.

US 149: No consensus for change.

 * It is unclear what this comment is referencing. There is no note in 23.3.7.3
[array.special]/3, and 23.2.1 [container.requirements.general]/9 already
excludes `array` from its general requirements.
 * Perhaps the objection is that the semantics of `array::swap` are never actually
defined anywhere -- do we use `swap(a[i], b[i])` to swap elements, or some other
mechanism such as move-assigning via a temporary? -- in which case this omission
does not seem editorial.
 * LWG concurs with this direction.

US 152: **LWG to handle issue**

 * This comment is not editorial.

US 157: Duplicate of US 91.

US 158: No consensus for change.

 * The Project Editor believes that including the description of the `<numerics>`
header in the "Algorithms" clause instead of the "Numerics" clause would harm
the organization of the standard.
One possible approach would be to rename the "Numerics" subclause to a name
that fits its remaining content, but LWG did not support that approach.
 * The last sentence of the proposed change for US 166 appears to be intended to
be part of this NB comment instead.
 * LWG concurs with this direction.

US 173: Accepted, fixed in 4fde500c.

US 179: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 662ddc79.

 * Renamed section label to
[optional.optional] since optional is not a class, matching [pairs.pair],
[tuple.tuple], [variant.variant].
 * LWG concurs with this direction.

US 180: Accepted with modifications, fixed in e62da07d.

 * Section label not changed (see US 179).
 * LWG concurs with this direction.

 * The definition of "character traits" is in 21.2/1. The relevant traits classes
are actually only defined in Clause 21, and the headers in Clause 22 don't even
declare these traits classes (although they do use them). The note is
sufficiently wrong that the best solution appears to be to remove it entirely.

JP 1: Accepted with modifications, fixed by 942b3fbc.

 * Additional changes:
   1. [iostream.objects.overview]/4: add cross-reference to C11 7.21.2, and replace
      "C standard" with "C standard library" for consistency
   2. [alg.c.library]/2: replace "C standard" with "C standard library" for
      consistency


JP 2: Accepted, fixed by c6552f06.

JP 3: **CWG to handle issue**

 * CWG wishes to investigate alternative wording changes.

JP 4: Accepted, fixed by 76308413.

JP 5: Accepted, fixed by 3e0038a3.

JP 6, JP 7, JP 14, JP 16, JP 17: No consensus for change.

 * The proposed change is not correct. The double-quote notation is used for the
   canonical type names defined by the algorithm in [dcl.meaning]. In this context,

   > function type `T`
   
   means `T`, where `T` is a function type. The suggested alternative of
   
   > ''function type `T`''
   
   would be meaningless. We could change the wording to
   
   > ''array of `T`'' or function type ''`T`''
   
   but the convention is to omit the ''...'' when surrounding a single type name.

JP 8: No consensus for change.

 * The comment is not correct. `declarator ;` is a valid function declaration when
the declarator declares a constructor, destructor, or conversion function. The
wording is therefore correct as written.
 * The proposed alternative wording would fail to capture the intent that the
declartor shall be well-formed as a declarator for a complete
function-declaration (not merely a valid function declarator).

JP 9: Accepted, fixed by aa74ca01.

JP 10, JP 11: No consensus for change.

 * The core language portion of the standard intentionally does not have a
consistent "house style" used in examples, in order to emphasize that the
language itself takes no position on questions of style.

JP 12: Accepted with modifications, fixed in b598c94e.

 * Figure is referenced by number instead of as "below".

JP 13: Accepted, fixed in ee809590.

JP 15: No consensus for change.

 * 12.5 does not appear to be relevant here. The cross-reference to 5.3.4 fully
describes how the matching deallocation function is determined. The
cross-reference to 3.7.4.2 is just for the term "deallocation function", and
covers both the class-specific and global cases.

JP 18: Accepted with modifications, fixed in a8654e86.

 * Solved by promoting the footnote into a note and splitting the surrounding
paragraph into multiple paragraphs.

 * The wording has been simplified in a different way from that proposed.

 * Each algorithm *with* a parallel form is now explicitly called out.
 * Duplicate of US 91.

Late 30: **LWG to handle issue**

 * The change appears correct but LWG feedback is requested to ensure that the
`s1 == s2` check wasn't trying to check something else beyond the fact that
the paths resolve to the same file system entity.

Late 42: Accepted, fixed in 3b22c874.

 * Of note: the Postcondition is impossible to guarantee, due to the possibility
of a file system race.
