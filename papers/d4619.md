## Notable changes to papers as moved

### LWG motion 11

The resolution of
[LWG issue 2753](http://wg21.link/lwg2753)
conflicts with the resolution of
[LWG issue 2756](http://wg21.link/lwg2756)
and has not been applied.
In particular,
LWG 2753 changes the draft to say that the
`optional(const optional<T>&)` constructor
should not participate in overload resolution
if `!is_copy_constructible_v<T>`, whereas
LWG 2756 changes the draft to say that the
constructor should be deleted in the same case.

## Disposition of editorial NB comments on C++ 2017 CD1

Listed below are responses and draft disposition for all comments that were
filed as editorial in the ISO 14882 CD (2016) NB comments,
[p0488r0](http://wg21.link/p0488r0),
and the late editorial comments in [p0489r0](http://wg21.link/p0489r0).
These dispositions only represent the current viewpoint of the Project Editor,
not the full committee, and are not final.

## ES Comments

### ES 3

Example is correct with or without proposed change.

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in f6482016.

## US Comments

### US 4

While `_v` forms are generally preferred in library clauses, defining the core
language semantics in terms of a variable template seems to introduce undue
complexity.

CWG concurs with this direction.

**Disposition:** No consensus for change.

### US 9

LWG concurs with this direction.

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 97058f9c.

### US 11

**Disposition:** Accepted with modifications. In the reference in paragraph 9, the ::value was removed to match similar specifications.

Fixed in 663f1324.

### US 12

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 0fdcc1ab.

### US 13

Specifying the value of `is_destructible_v<T>` within the specification for
`is_destructible` would be considerably less clear than specifying the value
of `is_destructible<T>::value`.

**Modified resolution:** Instead of proposed fix, change Condition for
`is_destructible` to:

> Condition: Either `T` is a reference type, or `T` is a complete object type
for which the expression `declval<U&>().~U()` is well-formed when treated
as an unevaluated operand (Clause [expr]), where `U` is
`remove_all_extents_t<T>`.

Note that this retains the property that `is_destructible_v<int[]>` is `false`.

LWG concurs with this direction.

**Disposition:** Accepted with modifications.

Fixed by 79974877.

### US 26

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed by 85aac089.

### US 27

Note: the comment is observing that there is an overly-wide space.

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed by fb925656.

### US 38

**Disposition:** Accepted.

LWG concurs with this direction. Fixed by adb0da05.

### US 39

**Disposition:** Accepted.

LWG concurs with this direction. Fixed by d47d5ca4.

### US 41

The Project Editor has no opinion on whether the current term or the proposed
term would be more appropriate.

**Disposition:** **LWG to handle issue**

LWG has deferred a decision on this to Kona.

### US 42

The suggested resolution contradicts [fs.op.status]/7, which indicates that
pathname resolution does always resolve a symlink. There is no other
specification of how pathname resolution behaves, so the proposed note would
not be justified by normative text.

**Disposition:** **LWG to handle issue**

LWG has deferred a decision on this to Kona.

### US 47

The Project Editor would like to see this comment addressed in some form, but
requests that LWG determine how to address this in the pathname grammar and
provide this change as an LWG issue resolution.

LWG has deferred a decision on this to Kona.

**Disposition:** **LWG to handle issue**

### US 50

The proposed change seems valuable, but would be a normative change if the type
is an input iterator type for which `decay_t` would produce a different type.
The Project Editor would like LWG to consider whether that change is acceptable.

**Disposition:** **LWG to handle issue**

LWG has deferred a decision on this to Kona.

### US 87

CWG considers the revised term to be less clear. A compromise term "block with
progress guarantee delegation" (removing the "forward" but retaining the
"guarantee") has been proposed.

**Disposition:** **SG1 to handle issue**

### US 88

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 554514cc.

### US 89

**Disposition:** Accepted with modifications. ("+" becomes "and".)

Fixed in 7e920239, d580a0dd.

### US 90

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 131716c4.

### US 91

LWG and SG1 concur with the direction of this issue.

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 0a344234.

### US 96

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in e6d9dfff.

### US 97

**Duplicate of US 4.**

### US 120

LWG concurs with this direction.

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in a8f966f5.

### US 133

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 71c347ed.

### US 136

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 27b46764.

### US 138

[func.requires] are requirements on the library, [requirements] are
requirements on the program. [func.requires] does not fit within
[requirements], nor within Clause 17 at all.

The call wrapper terms are not used outside the specified clause (except within
Annex D), so moving them to [definitions] does not seem useful.

**Disposition:** No consensus for change.

### US 149

It is unclear what this comment is referencing. There is no note in 23.3.7.3
[array.special]/3, and 23.2.1 [container.requirements.general]/9 already
excludes `array` from its general requirements.

Perhaps the objection is that the semantics of `array::swap` are never actually
defined anywhere -- do we use `swap(a[i], b[i])` to swap elements, or some other
mechanism such as move-assigning via a temporary? -- in which case this omission
does not seem editorial.

**Disposition:** No consensus for change.

LWG concurs with this direction.

### US 152

This comment is not editorial. **Reassigned to LWG.**

### US 157

**Duplicate of US 91.**

**Disposition:** Accepted.

### US 158

The Project Editor believes that including the description of the `<numerics>`
header in the "Algorithms" clause instead of the "Numerics" clause would harm
the organization of the standard.
One possible approach would be to rename the "Numerics" subclause to a name
that fits its remaining content, but LWG did not support that approach.

The last sentence of the proposed change for US 166 appears to be intended to
be part of this NB comment instead.

**Disposition:** No consensus for change.

LWG concurs with this direction.

### US 173

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 4fde500c.

### US 179

LWG concurs with this direction.

**Disposition:** Accepted with modifications. Renamed section label to
[optional.optional] since optional is not a class, matching [pairs.pair],
[tuple.tuple], [variant.variant].

Fixed in 662ddc79.

### US 180

LWG concurs with this direction.

**Disposition:** Accepted with modifications. Section label not changed (see US 179).

Fixed in e62da07d.

### US 182

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed by e229a482.

### GB 29

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 6621ef71.

### GB 31

The definition of "character traits" is in 21.2/1. The relevant traits classes
are actually only defined in Clause 21, and the headers in Clause 22 don't even
declare these traits classes (although they do use them). The note is
sufficiently wrong that the best solution appears to be to remove it entirely.

**Disposition:** Accepted with modifications. Remove note.

Fixed in 32b2de88.

## RU Comments

No editorial comments.

## JP Comments

### JP 1

Additional changes:

 * [iostream.objects.overview]/4: add cross-reference to C11 7.21.2, and replace
   "C standard" with "C standard library" for consistency
 * [alg.c.library]/2: replace "C standard" with "C standard library" for
   consistency

**Disposition:** Accepted with modifications.

Fixed by 942b3fbc.

### JP 2

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed by c6552f06.

### JP 3

CWG wishes to investigate alternative wording changes.

**Disposition:** **CWG to handle issue**

### JP 4

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed by 76308413.

### JP 5

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed by 3e0038a3.

### JP 6, JP 7, JP 14, JP 16, JP 17

The proposed change is not correct. The double-quote notation is used for the
canonical type names defined by the algorithm in [dcl.meaning]. In this context,

> function type `T`

means `T`, where `T` is a function type. The suggested alternative of

> ''function type `T`''

would be meaningless. We could change the wording to

> ''array of `T`'' or function type ''`T`''

but the convention is to omit the ''...'' when surrounding a single type name.

**Disposition:** No consensus for change.

### JP 8

The comment is not correct. `declarator ;` is a valid function declaration when
the declarator declares a constructor, destructor, or conversion function. The
wording is therefore correct as written.

The proposed alternative wording would fail to capture the intent that the
declartor shall be well-formed as a declarator for a complete
function-declaration (not merely a valid function declarator).

**Disposition:** No consensus for change.

### JP 9

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed by aa74ca01.

### JP 10, JP 11

The core language portion of the standard intentionally does not have a
consistent "house style" used in examples, in order to emphasize that the
language itself takes no position on questions of style.

**Disposition:** No consensus for change.

### JP 12

**Disposition:** Accepted with modifications. Figure is referenced by number
instead of as "below".

Fixed in b598c94e.

### JP 13

**Disposition:** Accepted.

### JP 15

12.5 does not appear to be relevant here. The cross-reference to 5.3.4 fully
describes how the matching deallocation function is determined. The
cross-reference to 3.7.4.2 is just for the term "deallocation function", and
covers both the class-specific and global cases.

**Disposition:** No consensus for change.

### JP 18

Solved by promoting the footnote into a note and splitting the surrounding
paragraph into multiple paragraphs.

**Disposition:** Accepted with modifications.

Fixed in 472a7176.

### Late 15

**Disposition:** Accepted.

Fixed in 066aba68.

### Late 30

The change appears correct but LWG feedback is requested to ensure that the
`s1 == s2` check wasn't trying to check something else beyond the fact that
the paths resolve to the same file system entity.

**Disposition:** **LWG to handle issue**

### Late 42

Of note: the Postcondition is impossible to guarantee, due to the possibility
of a file system race.

**Disposition:** Accepted.
