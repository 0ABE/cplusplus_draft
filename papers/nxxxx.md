## Disposition of editorial NB comments on C++ 2020 CD1

Listed below are draft disposition for all comments that were
filed as editorial in the ISO 14882 CD (2019) NB comments,
[Nxxxx](http://wg21.link/nxxxx).
Except where otherwise noted, these dispositions only represent the current
viewpoint of the Project Editor.

US 021: Accepted, fixed in 50e55ce9.

 * Split index entries to "block (execution)" and "block (statement)".
 * Also added the statement form to Clause 3, Terms and Definitions.

GB 022: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 8cc6bd34.

 * The relevant change had already been made to [using.headers],
   but this corresponding change was missed.

JP 023: Accepted, fixed in 868934f7.

JP 030: No consensus for change.

 * The text immediately following the grammar makes it clear that
   both lowercase `p` and uppercase `P` are permitted.

US 031: No consensus for change.

 * The example appears to be valid as-is;
   adding `!= 0` does not appear to serve any purpose.

GB 032: Accepted, fixed in 84a1cd53.

US 037: **SG2 to handle issue**

 * The proposed change is not editorial.

JP 045: Accepted, fixed in d401794f.

 * This fixes a misapplication of the resolution of CWG 2381.

US 047: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 785f689d.

 * **Modified resolution:**
  Instead of removing the redundant sentence, it was converted into a note
  and moved after the following sentence of which it is a consequence.

US 052: **CWG to handle issue**

 * The proposed change is not editorial.

JP 057: Accepted, fixed in a06b7a49.

GB 078: Accepted, fixed in e3bb2eba.

 * Italicized references to *digit*s that intended to refer to the grammar production.
 * Also made some nearby editorial improvements:
   added cross-references and fixed an adjacent grammar issue ("is" / "are") in [diff.cpp14.library].

GB 079: **Deferred until US 036 is resolved**

US 085: No consensus for change.

 * Per the description in [module.import],
   translation units are imported, modules are not.
   The wording appears to be correct as-is.

US 088: Accepted with modifications, fixed in d382ea4e.

 * **Modified resolution:**
  Instead of either of the proposed renamings,
  renamed [module.global] to [module.global.frag] and
  renamed [cpp.glob.frag] to [cpp.global.frag].

GB 089: Accepted, fixed in fa42d5a6.

US 099: Accepted, fixed in 9b0502bf.

US 106: **CWG to handle issue**

US 108: Accepted, fixed in 2f42a930.

US 153: Propose accepting; **LWG to approve direction**

 * Can be handled editorially if approved.

US 154: Duplicate of US 153.

US 155: Propose accepting; **LWG to approve direction**

 * Can be handled editorially if approved.

JP 177: Accepted, fixed in 8be40ff0.

 * Replaces a reference to ISO/IEC/IEEE 60599 with a reference to the intended ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559.
 * IEC 60599 is "Mineral oil-filled electrical equipment in service --
   guidance on the interpretation of dissolved and free gases analysis"
 * ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 is "Information Technology - Microprocessor Systems --
   Floating-Point Arithmetic"

GB 200: No consensus for change.

 * The example already includes all combinations of `const`/non-`const` LHS and RHS,
   as described by paragraph 6.
   The suggested combinations `b == d` and `a == c` are both identical to `a == d`.
   (Note that only `a` and `c` are used on the LHS,
    and only `b` and `d` are used on the RHS.)

US 216: Propose accepting; **LWG to approve direction**

 * Can be handled editorially if approved.

JP 218: **LWG to handle issue**

JP 219: **LWG to handle issue**

GB 225: **LWG to handle issue**

US 242: Propose rejecting; **LWG to approve direction**

 * Organizationally, it seems more consistent to list `span` near the
   sequence containers, just as we list `string_view` near `string.

US 258: Accepted, fixed in f36f871c.

US 280: **LEWG to select a better name or reject**

 * Can be handled editorially if an alternative name is approved.

US 295: **TODO**

JP 314: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 136312cf.

 * This is not an ISO "Terms and Definitions" Clause,
   so the rules for such a Clause do not apply.
 * **Modified resolution:**
   Renamed subclause from "Terms and Definitions" to "Preamble"
   to make it clear that this is not an ISO "Terms and Definitions" Clause.
   Also moved [algorithms.parallel] paragraph 1 into this subclause
   to avoid a hanging paragraph.

JP 319: Accepted, fixed in 5ac298cc.

US 325: No consensus for change.

 * We do not wish to perform this reorganization at this stage,
   but will reconsider the organization of the standard library clauses
   for a future standard.

US 327: **SG6 / LEWG to handle issue**

 * The proposed change is not editorial.
 * Duplicate of PL 326

US 328: **SG6 / LEWG to handle issue**

 * The proposed change is not editorial.

US 330: No consensus for change.

 * The wording to which this comment is objecting
   was removed by [P1355R2](http://wg21.link/p1355r2),
   which was adopted by 2019-07 LWG Motion 2.

GB 335: **LWG to handle issue**

 * The intent of the wording is unclear;
   this issue cannot be resolved editorially.

JP 338: Accepted, fixed in 742f1086.

JP 339: Accepted, fixed in 25a08918.

JP 340: Accepted, fixed in f88f6747.

JP 341: Accepted, fixed in d545c37d.

JP 343: Accepted, fixed in 9252441e.

JP 348: Accepted, fixed in 01dea5f5.

 * Adding the default template arguments here is likely not the best resolution in the long term.
   The explicit default template arguments, if implemented literally, would disallow including
   this header and `<iosfwd>` in the same translation unit.
   However, adding them here makes this header consistent with the rest of this Clause.
 * An LWG issue will be opened to consider
   whether we should require more of the iostreams headers to include `<iosfwd>` and
   which header inclusions should result in the default arguments being made available.

JP 349: Accepted, fixed in adcf12ea.

 * See JP 348.

JP 350: Accepted, fixed in 53b429c9.

 * See JP 348.

US 357: Accepted with modifications, fixed in af747d64.

 * **Modified resolution:**
   A different revised wording was chosen for the notes:
   "The specialization `atomic<bool>` uses the primary template."

US 359: **SG1 / LWG to handle issue**

JP 362: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 195d5bab.

 * **Modified resolution:**
   In addition to adding the missing `[[nodiscard]]`,
   also added the missing `static` and `int` from the synopsis.

CA 366: Accepted, fixed in eaf23727.

JP 373: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 41058d90.

 * **Modified resolution:** In addition to requested changes,
   also added cross-reference to [temp.pre]
   for the *requires-clause* grammar production.

JP 374: Accepted, fixed in dbc3d6a5.

JP 376: Accepted, fixed in 8b5c768e.
