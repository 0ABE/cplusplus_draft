## Disposition of editorial NB comments on C++ 2020 CD1

Listed below are draft disposition for all comments that were
filed as editorial in the ISO 14882 CD (2019) NB comments,
[Nxxxx](http://wg21.link/nxxxx).
Except where otherwise noted, these dispositions only represent the current
viewpoint of the Project Editor.

US 021: Accepted, fixed in [50e55ce9](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/50e55ce9).

 * Split index entries to "block (execution)" and "block (statement)".
 * Also added the statement form to Clause 3, Terms and Definitions.

GB 022: Accepted with modifications, fixed in [8cc6bd34](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/8cc6bd34).

 * The relevant change had already been made to [using.headers],
   but this corresponding change was missed.

 * **Modified resolution:**
   Added a cross-reference to [using.headers] instead of
   the suggested cross-reference to [headers].

JP 023: Accepted, fixed in [868934f7](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/868934f7).

JP 030: No consensus for change.

 * The text immediately following the grammar makes it clear that
   both lowercase `p` and uppercase `P` are permitted.

US 031: No consensus for change.

 * The example appears to be valid as-is;
   adding `!= 0` does not appear to serve any purpose.

GB 032: Accepted, fixed in [84a1cd53](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/84a1cd53).

US 037: No consensus for change.

 * The proposed change is not editorial.
   Forwarded to SG2 for consideration and rejected.

FR 039: Accepted with modifications, fixed in [68a6dfef](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/68a6dfef).

 * **Filed as technical**; SG2 concluded the wording is confusing,
   already does what the comment requests
   (except that ADL also finds friend declarations in a class
   in the same conditions under which
   member lookup would find member declarations in the class).
   Recategorized as editorial to clarify the wording.

 * **Modified resolution:**
   Definition of "interface" (of a module) inlined into its only use (and removed),
   making it clear that [basic.lookup.argdep]/4.4 only finds exported declarations.

JP 045: Accepted, fixed in [d401794f](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/d401794f).

 * This fixes a misapplication of the resolution of CWG 2381.

US 047: Accepted with modifications, fixed in [785f689d](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/785f689d).

 * **Modified resolution:**
  Instead of removing the redundant sentence, it was converted into a note
  and moved after the following sentence of which it is a consequence.

US 052: TODO Accepted contingent on P1971R0

 * The proposed change is not editorial.
   Forwarded to CWG for consideration and accepted.

JP 057: Accepted, fixed in [a06b7a49](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/a06b7a49).

GB 078: Accepted, fixed in [e3bb2eba](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/e3bb2eba).

 * Italicized references to *digit*s that intended to refer to the grammar production.
 * Also made some nearby editorial improvements:
   added cross-references and fixed an adjacent grammar issue ("is" / "are") in [diff.cpp14.library].

GB 079: TODO Accepted contingent on P1971R0

 * Forwarded to SG2 for consideration. Accepted and example added by CWG.

US 085: No consensus for change.

 * Per the description in [module.import],
   translation units are imported, modules are not.
   The wording appears to be correct as-is.

US 088: Accepted with modifications, fixed in [d382ea4e](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/d382ea4e).

 * **Modified resolution:**
  Instead of either of the proposed renamings,
  renamed [module.global] to [module.global.frag] and
  renamed [cpp.glob.frag] to [cpp.global.frag].

GB 089: Accepted, fixed in [fa42d5a6](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/fa42d5a6).

US 099: Accepted, fixed in [9b0502bf](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/9b0502bf).

US 106: No consensus for change.

 * Forwarded to CWG for consideration and rejected.

US 108: Accepted, fixed in [2f42a930](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/2f42a930).

US 153: No consensus for change.

 * Forwarded to LWG for consideration; rejected by LEWG.

US 154: Duplicate of US 153.

GB 155: Accepted, fixed in [98e57ff5](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/98e57ff5).

 * **LWG concurs with this direction**

JP 177: Accepted, fixed in [8be40ff0](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/8be40ff0).

 * Replaces a reference to ISO/IEC/IEEE 60599 with a reference to the intended ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559.
 * IEC 60599 is "Mineral oil-filled electrical equipment in service --
   guidance on the interpretation of dissolved and free gases analysis"
 * ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 is "Information Technology - Microprocessor Systems --
   Floating-Point Arithmetic"

GB 200: No consensus for change.

 * The example already includes all combinations of `const`/non-`const` LHS and RHS,
   as described by paragraph 6.
   The suggested combinations `b == d` and `a == c` are both identical to `a == d`.
   (Note that only `a` and `c` are used on the LHS,
    and only `b` and `d` are used on the RHS.)

US 216: Accepted, fixed in [dfcc4691](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/dfcc4691).

 * **LWG concurs with this direction**

JP 218: **Unresolved, reassigned to LWG**

 * Forwarded to LWG for consideration;

JP 219: **Unresolved, reassigned to LWG**

 * Forwarded to LWG for consideration;

   [LWG issue 3327](https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue3327) opened to track this comment.

US 242: No consensus for change.

 * Organizationally, it seems more consistent to list `span` near the
   sequence containers, just as we list `string_view` near `string.

 * Forwarded to LWG for consideration and rejected.

US 258: Accepted, fixed in [f36f871c](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/f36f871c).

GB 280: TODO Accepted contingent on P1870R1

 * Forwarded to LEWG to select a better name or reject,
   LEWG selected `safe_range` as a replacement non-exposition-only concept name.

US 295: Accepted with modifications, fixed in [53f0651e](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/53f0651e).

 * Instead of proposed change, incorporated the leading
   "If `ref_is_glvalue` is `true`" into the bullets
   and removed the bullet nesting
   to clarify the meaning of the "Otherwise"s.

JP 314: Accepted with modifications, fixed in [136312cf](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/136312cf).

 * This is not an ISO "Terms and Definitions" Clause,
   so the rules for such a Clause do not apply.
 * **Modified resolution:**
   Renamed subclause from "Terms and Definitions" to "Preamble"
   to make it clear that this is not an ISO "Terms and Definitions" Clause.
   Also moved [algorithms.parallel] paragraph 1 into this subclause
   to avoid a hanging paragraph.

JP 319: Accepted, fixed in [5ac298cc](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/5ac298cc).

US 325: No consensus for change.

 * We do not wish to perform this reorganization at this stage,
   but will reconsider the organization of the standard library clauses
   for a future standard.

US 327: **Unresolved, reassigned to LEWG**

 * The proposed change is not editorial.
   Forwarded to LEWG for consideration.
 * Duplicate of PL 326, which may be addressed by [P1956](http://wg21.link/p1956).

US 328: **Unresolved, reassigned to LEWG**

 * The proposed change is not editorial.
   Forwarded to LEWG for consideration.
 * Duplicate of PL 326, which may be addressed by [P1956](http://wg21.link/p1956).

US 330: No consensus for change.

 * The wording to which this comment is objecting
   was removed by [P1355R2](http://wg21.link/p1355r2),
   which was adopted by 2019-07 LWG Motion 2.

JP 338: Accepted, fixed in [742f1086](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/742f1086).

JP 339: Accepted, fixed in [25a08918](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/25a08918).

JP 340: Accepted, fixed in [f88f6747](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/f88f6747).

JP 341: Accepted, fixed in [d545c37d](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/d545c37d).

JP 343: Accepted, fixed in [9252441e](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/9252441e).

JP 348: Accepted, fixed in [01dea5f5](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/01dea5f5).

 * Per [iosfwd.syn]p1, the duplication of default template arguments
   between `<iosfwd>` and `<syncstream>`
   does not prevent a translation unit including both.
 * An LWG issue will be opened to consider
   whether we should require more of the iostreams headers to include `<iosfwd>`;
   currently only `<ios>` and `<iostream>` are guaranteed to provide the forward declarations.
   Similarly LWG should consider whether `<istream>` and `<ostream>` should
   be guaranteed to include `<ios>`.

JP 349: Accepted, fixed in [adcf12ea](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/adcf12ea).

 * See JP 348.

JP 350: Accepted, fixed in [53b429c9](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/53b429c9).

 * See JP 348.

US 357: Accepted with modifications, fixed in [af747d64](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/af747d64).

 * **Modified resolution:**
   A different revised wording was chosen for the notes:
   "The specialization `atomic<bool>` uses the primary template."

US 359: TODO Accepted contingent on P1960

 * Forwarded to SG1 for consideration and accepted by LWG.

JP 362: Accepted with modifications, fixed in [195d5bab](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/195d5bab).

 * **Modified resolution:**
   In addition to adding the missing `[[nodiscard]]`,
   also added the missing `static` and `int` from the synopsis.

CA 366: Accepted, fixed in [eaf23727](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/eaf23727).

JP 373: Accepted with modifications, fixed in [41058d90](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/41058d90).

 * **Modified resolution:** In addition to requested changes,
   also added cross-reference to [temp.pre]
   for the *requires-clause* grammar production.

JP 374: Accepted, fixed in [dbc3d6a5](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/dbc3d6a5).
