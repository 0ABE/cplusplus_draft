## Notable editorial changes

 * CWG 6: In application of P0298R3, updated introductory sentence of [cstddef.syn]
   to avoid claiming that `std::byte` is part of ISO C's `<stddef.h>` header.

 * CWG 9: Change to [csignal.syn] was not applied, because the desired normative
   effect had already been accomplished by [P0175R1](http://wg21.link/p0175r1),
   which was applied at the previous meeting and removed the baseline text for
   this change. The effect of the merge is that `std::signal` is *not* required
   to itself have C language linkage (but its parameter and returned function
   pointer types are). Also added subclause to house description of signal
   handlers, rather than including it in the `<csignal>` header synopsis.

 * LWG 4: The normative description of `directory_entry::is_directory` is
   specified in terms of a non-existent `file_status` member, and either the
   `status` or `symlink_status` members could have been intended. After
   [consulting with LWG](http://lists.isocpp.org/lib/2017/03/2262.php),
   this usage of `file_status` has been replaced by `status`.
